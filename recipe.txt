**1. Gather your supplies:**

*  A head of cabbage (green or red works great!)
*  Kosher salt (around 2 tablespoons per pound of cabbage)
*  A large bowl
*  A sharp knife or mandoline (for shredding)
*  A clean glass jar (mason jar works well)
*  A weight to keep the cabbage submerged (a small glass filled with water works in a pinch)

**2. Prep the cabbage:**

*  Wash and core the cabbage. 
*  Thinly shred the cabbage. You can use a knife or mandoline for this.

**3. Salt and massage:**

*  Place the shredded cabbage in the large bowl.
*  Sprinkle the salt over the cabbage and massage it in with your hands for 5-10 minutes. You'll see the cabbage wilt and release liquid. This is good!

**4. Pack and weigh down:**

*  Pack the softened cabbage mixture into your clean jar. 
*  Press down firmly to ensure the cabbage is submerged in the released brine. 
*  Top it off with any extra brine, if needed.

**5. Fermentation time!**

*  Place a clean cabbage leaf or cloth over the top of the jar. 
*  Screw on the lid (leave it slightly loose to allow gas to escape). 
*  Place the jar in a cool, dark spot (like a cupboard) for a few weeks (usually 1-4 weeks). 
*  Every few days, burp the jar by opening the lid slightly to release any built-up pressure.

**6. Enjoy your creation!**

*  Once the sauerkraut reaches your desired level of tanginess, store it in the refrigerator. 
*  Enjoy it on hot dogs, sausages, sandwiches, or even just as a healthy snack!

**Tips:**

* Feel free to add some flavor variations!  Try adding sliced carrots, peppercorns, caraway seeds, or even a bay leaf during step 3.
* Be patient! The longer it ferments, the tangier the sauerkraut will become. 
* Keep an eye on your jar during fermentation. You might see some white film on top - this is harmless. If you see mold, however, discard the batch.
