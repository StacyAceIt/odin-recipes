# odin-recipes
<!-- what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.) -->
This odin-recipe project is created for the Foundation course of Odin Project. 

It displays an index page with links to several recipes. I'll learn basic HTML through this project.
